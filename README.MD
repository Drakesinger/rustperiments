# Rust(ex)periements

A place where I play around with rust.

## Projects

- `zatanna-says` :
  A small command line application to which you give a sentence and it will tell it back to you in reverse order.
- `triangle-from-scratch` :
  Following [Lokathor's rust tutorial to get a triangle drawing on screen without libs](https://rust-tutorials.github.io/triangle-from-scratch/), this small app presents the first steps in my attempt to migrate the work I already did following [Casey Muratori's Handmade Hero stream](https://hero.handmade.network/episode/code), which will then be followed by work to get an actual 3D model rendering. This will be done via either a direct integartion with [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) or the `.blend`.
