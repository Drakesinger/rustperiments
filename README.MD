# Rust(ex)periements

A place where I play around with rust.

## Projects

- [`zatanna-says`](https://github.com/Drakesinger/zatanna-says) :
  
  A small command line application to which you give a sentence and it will tell it back to you in reverse order.
- [`triangle-from-scratch`](https://github.com/Drakesinger/triangle-from-scratch) :
  
  Following [Lokathor's rust tutorial to get a triangle drawing on screen without libs](https://rust-tutorials.github.io/triangle-from-scratch/), this small app presents the first steps in my attempt to migrate the work I already did following [Casey Muratori's Handmade Hero stream](https://hero.handmade.network/episode/code).
